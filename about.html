<h2>It's just me</h2>
<img src="pic.png" id="img1">
<p>My name is Grace. I am just an ordinary person with extraordinary love for arts and music. I hold 
    a job that compel me to go to work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. I took arts and music as my pastime
    and hobby. It's one way of destressing myself after  a busy and hectic week. <br><br>

    My drawings are just simple. I love to draw my pets, animals and nature. My favorite drawing materials
    are pencils and colored pencils. Though I made some watercolor drawings but I've found it kinda hard.

<p id="p1">I do also love to sing. For me, music is a language where you can express your emotions. Music uplifts mood.
    Through music, it can defuse and unpleasant state. <br><br>
    I expressed myself through my arts and music. My love for them is deep. Forever this would be part of my
    existence.
</p>

<p>"With music and art, I can create the kind of world in which I wish to live" -- Joseph Curiale</p>
