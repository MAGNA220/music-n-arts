<h2>It's just me</h2>
<img src="pic.png" id="img1">
<p>My name is Grace, and I am an ordinary person with an extraordinary love for arts and music. I have a job that requires me to work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. However, I have taken up arts and music as my pastime and hobby. It's a way for me to destress myself after a busy and hectic week.

My drawings are simple. I love to draw my pets, animals, and nature using pencils and colored pencils, although I have attempted some watercolor drawings which I found to be challenging.

<p id="p1">I also love to sing, as for me, music is a language where one can express their emotions. It can uplift one's mood and diffuse any unpleasant state.

I express myself through my arts and music, and my love for them runs deep. They will forever be a part of my existence.
</p>

<p>"With music and art, I can create the kind of world in which I wish to live" -- Joseph Curiale</p>
